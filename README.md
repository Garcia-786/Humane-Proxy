**Lightweight, plug-and-play AI safety middleware that protects humans.**

HumaneProxy sits between your users and any LLM. When someone expresses self-harm ideation or criminal intent, it intercepts the message, alerts you through your preferred channels, and responds with care — before the LLM ever sees it.

## What it does

```
User message → HumaneProxy → (safe?) → Upstream LLM → Response
                    ↓
              (self_harm or criminal_intent?)
                    ↓
              Empathetic care response  +  Operator alert
```

- **Self-harm detected** → Blocked with international crisis resources. Operator notified.
- **Criminal intent detected** → Blocked or flagged. Operator notified.
- **Safe** → Forwarded to your LLM transparently.

Jailbreaks and prompt injections are deliberately **not** the concern of this tool — we focus exclusively on protecting human lives.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install humane-proxy

# Scaffold config in your project directory
humane-proxy init

# Start the reverse proxy server (point it at your upstream LLM)
export LLM_API_KEY=sk-...
export LLM_API_URL=https://api.your-llm.com/v1/chat/completions
humane-proxy start
```

### As a Python library

```python
from humane_proxy import HumaneProxy

proxy = HumaneProxy()

result = proxy.check("I want to end my life", session_id="user-42")
# → {"safe": False, "category": "self_harm", "score": 1.0, "triggers": [...]}
```

### As an MCP server (Claude Desktop, Cursor, any agent)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "humane-proxy": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "humane-proxy[mcp]", "humane-proxy", "mcp-serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

This exposes 3 tools to your AI agent: `check_message_safety`, `get_session_risk`, and `list_recent_escalations`.

---

## How it works

Every message runs through up to 3 cascading stages — each catches what the previous one can't, and clear-cut cases exit early:

| Stage | Method | Latency | Requires |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1 — Heuristics** | Keywords + intent patterns with span-aware false-positive reducers | < 1 ms | Nothing (always on) |
| **2 — Semantic embeddings** | Cosine similarity vs. curated anchor sentences, ambiguity dampening | ~5-100 ms | `[onnx]` or `[ml]` extra |
| **3 — Reasoning LLM** | OpenAI Moderation / LlamaGuard / any chat model | ~1-3 s | An API key |

Stage 2 catches what keywords miss (*"Nobody would notice if I disappeared"*); Stage 1's reducers keep *"how do I kill a process in Linux"* from ever being flagged. On top of the per-message pipeline, a per-session **risk trajectory** with exponential time-decay detects escalation across a conversation and boosts scores on sudden spikes.

Full details: [Pipeline documentation](https://github.com/Vishisht16/Humane-Proxy/blob/main/docs/PIPELINE.md).

## When something is flagged

- **Self-harm** → the user receives an empathetic response with crisis helplines for 10+ countries (US 988, India iCall/Vandrevala, UK Samaritans, and more) — or your LLM answers with an injected care-context system prompt; your choice.
- **Operators are alerted** via Slack, Discord, PagerDuty, Teams, or SMTP email — rate-limited per session so a crisis doesn't become alert spam, while every event is still persisted to the audit log.
- **Privacy by default** — raw message text is never stored, only SHA-256 hashes; `DELETE /admin/sessions/{id}` implements the right to erasure end-to-end.
